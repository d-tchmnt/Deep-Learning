# Deep-Learning
Given an image of a fashion item, build a deep learning model that recognizes the fashion item. You
must use at least 2 different architectures, one with MLPs and one with CNNs. Use the Fashion-
MNIST dataset to train and evaluate your models. More information about the task and the dataset
can be found at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. The dataset is also available from
Tensorflow and Keras.
